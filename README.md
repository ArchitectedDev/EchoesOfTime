# **Echoes of Time**

A **time tracking application** designed for task management and accurate time tracking, built using WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation) with the MVVM architectural pattern.

## **Overview**

**Echoes of Time** is a desktop application that allows users to track time spent on tasks efficiently. It supports managing tasks for specific dates, tracking elapsed time for active tasks, and manually adjusting task durations.

### **Key Features**
- **Task Management**:
  - Add, delete, and manage tasks for specific dates.
- **Time Tracking**:
  - Activate a task to track elapsed time automatically.
  - Manually increment or decrement task time.
- **Single Active Task**:
  - Ensures only one task can be active at a time.
- **Persistent Storage**:
  - Uses SQLite for saving and retrieving tasks.
- **User-Friendly UI**:
  - Buttons and icons with intuitive Unicode symbols for actions:
    - âž• Add Task
    - âž– Decrement Time
    - âž• Increment Time
    - ðŸ—‘ Delete Task
    - ðŸŽ¯ Go to Active Task
- **Dynamic Date Navigation**:
  - Navigate tasks for specific dates using Previous and Next buttons.
  - View tasks for the active date with a "Go to Active Task" button.
